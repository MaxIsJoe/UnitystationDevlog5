# Audio requirements

* Bitrate: 320Kbps
* Length: Less than or exactly 60 seconds.
* Must be processed in audacity to clear all background noise.

Not a requirement, but it is best if all sound clips follow the same profile and audio clarity.


# How to download/update assets

1 - Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed.

2 - Run assetGrabbed.py

3 - Your assets folder should now be updated accordingly.


# How to share assets.

1 - Zip both your audio export and its audacity save file.

2 - Name your zipFile like this:

`subject_[number] (ID).zip`

* subject being the thing we're talking about or voicing.
* number being the take for a line spoken.

3 - Upload your zip file to https://catbox.moe/ 

4 - Inside assets.txt, create a newline and insert the video data as followed:

`subject_[number] (ID).zip - LinkToZipFile`

Make sure to update `ID` to a random 4 letter ID if you're updating the file with another version.
