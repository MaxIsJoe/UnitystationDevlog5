As unitystation enters its 3rd year without a new devlog, there has been over [3500+](https://github.com/unitystation/unitystation/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+created%3A%3C2021-02-13+) submited PRs that all add new additions, bug fixes and polish to unitystation. Those changes were never communicated to anyone outside our own sphere, which resulted in unitystation going into obscurity for quite sometime.

This repo is a collabrotive effort to work on an unoffical 5th devlog episode that reflects the state of our efforts after all this time.


# Goals

* Make a compact video with short bits and story telling elements to engage the viewer.
* Cover every significant new feature added to unitystation since february 2021.
* Highlight all the hardwork of our contributors and our dedicated playerbase.

# Tools

- Video editing / VFX: Blender
- Automation: Python
- Story boarding / Art: Krita and GIMP
- Audio Recording: Audacity

# Project structure

To avoid Github's annoying file restrictions, all our assets will be hosted on a file services like https://catbox.moe/ 

We will store all links to large assets (like video or audio) in .txt files in each folder designated for its usecase, then contributors will have to use the provided python scripts that loops through all links within the .txt files and downloads/updates all the required assets when needed.

This only applies to video and audio formats. Art documents and images are exempt from this restriction and can be pushed directly to this repo.
